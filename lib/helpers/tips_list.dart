    titleText_1_Info:
        '''Strength Training: Incorporating resistance exercises like weightlifting, bodyweight workouts (push-ups, squats), and resistance band exercises helps build muscle strength. Aim for 2-4 strength sessions per week, focusing on different muscle groups.

Progressive Overload: Gradually increase the weight, resistance, or intensity of your exercises. This forces your muscles to adapt, promoting growth and strength over time.

Proper Nutrition: A protein-rich diet is essential for muscle repair and growth. Include lean proteins (chicken, fish, beans) and maintain a balanced intake of carbohydrates and healthy fats for energy and recovery.

Rest and Recovery: Muscles grow during rest, so ensure proper sleep and rest between workouts to prevent overtraining and injuries. Rest days are just as crucial as workout days for gaining strength.''',

    titleText_1_Info:
        '''Support and Stability: Training shoes should provide proper support and stability, especially during weightlifting or high-intensity exercises. Look for shoes with a firm sole and good arch support to prevent injuries and improve performance.

Flexibility and Cushioning: If you're doing cardio, running, or agility drills, opt for shoes with adequate cushioning and flexibility. This helps absorb impact and allows natural foot movement, reducing the risk of strain.

Breathability and Comfort: Ensure the shoes are breathable and comfortable to wear during long training sessions. Lightweight, breathable materials keep your feet cool and reduce discomfort.

Grip and Traction: For exercises like running or outdoor training, shoes with a good grip are essential to prevent slipping and ensure stability on various surfaces.
